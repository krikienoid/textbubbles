# TextBubbles

###### Visualize text as a series of bubbles representing word size.


[Demo HERE](http://krikienoid.github.io/textbubbles/index.html)


## What does it do?

Input a body of text into the field, and see a representation of the text as a series of bubbles, each bubble representing one word. The bubble's size is proportional to word length and can be determined by radius (linearly) or by area (quadratically).


Inspired by the works from the following [thread on reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2l6gq1/text_bubbles_to_contrast_complexity_of_writing_in/).


*Works best on English text, but has limited support for some foreign langauges.*
